# Blockchain-Based E-Voting System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Blockchain-Based E-Voting System** provides a **secure, transparent, and decentralized online voting platform**. It addresses key issues in traditional voting like centralized control, lack of transparency, and voter fraud.  
By using **blockchain’s immutability and decentralization**, this system ensures that votes remain tamper-proof and verifiable. It also enables **remote voting** through the internet for increased voter participation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a **secure online voting system** using blockchain.
- Eliminate the risk of **centralized data manipulation**.
- Ensure **voter anonymity and data integrity**.
- Automate election processes with **smart contracts**.
- Enable **real-time vote verification and monitoring**.
- Support **large-scale elections** with low latency.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Technology       | Purpose                 |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Java             | Backend Logic           |
| JSP              | Web Interface           |
| MySQL            | Database Management     |
| Blockchain       | Conceptual Framework    |
| DES Encryption   | Data Security           |


## 🗂️ System Architecture
The system includes:
- **Admin Panel:** Manage voters, elections, and results.
- **Voter Portal:** Register, authenticate, and cast votes.
- **Blockchain Ledger (Conceptual):** Decentralized vote recording.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate registration, voting, and result tallying.
- **Security Layer:** Encryption, vote integrity, and user role management.


## 🔒 Key Features
- ✅ **Decentralization:** No central authority controls the database.
- ✅ **Immutable Records:** Votes cannot be altered once cast.
- ✅ **Smart Contracts:** Automate critical election workflows.
- ✅ **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track votes live via transparent logs.
- ✅ **Quantum-Resistant Security:** Future-proof against evolving threats.
- ✅ **Voter Anonymity:** Secures voter identities.
- ✅ **Admin Control:** Manage users and voting events securely.


## 💻 Functionalities
### Admin Panel
- Admin registration & login
- Add/Delete voter records
- Monitor voting progress
- View election results

### Voter Portal
- Voter registration
- Secure login
- Vote casting (Single attempt enforced)
- Real-time vote confirmation


## 🔐 Security Implementations
- **DES Encryption:** Secure vote storage and transmission.
- **Database Security:** Restricted user access based on roles.
- **Vote Integrity:** Single-vote enforcement through flagging.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Ensures vote privacy.


## ⚙️ Database Schema
- **Users Table:** Admin and voter credentials.
